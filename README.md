## Usage

1. **Automatic**: Workflows trigger on pushes and PRs
2. **Manual**: Use "Actions" tab ‚Üí "Run workflow" for manual execution
3. **Releases**: Create tags with `v*` pattern (e.g., `v1.0.0`)

## Configuration

Some workflows require secrets to be configured in repository settings:
- `SONAR_TOKEN`: For SonarCloud analysis
- `CODECOV_TOKEN`: For coverage reporting

The workflows are designed to be adaptive and will automatically detect your project type (Node.js, Python, etc.) and run appropriate steps.
